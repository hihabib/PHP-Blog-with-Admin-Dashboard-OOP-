This project provides an Author Dashboard with the following features:

## User Authentication
- Authors can log in and log out using their email and password.

## Category Management
- Authors can add new categories for blog posts.
- Each category can have two statuses: 'active' and 'inactive'.

## Blog Post Management
- Authors can create and manage blog posts with the following attributes:
  - Title
  - Content (using a WYSIWYG editor)
  - Tags
  - Category
  - Slug
  - Thumbnail <b style="color: red">(With Image Compression feature)</b>
  - Status (can be one of 'Published', 'Draft', or 'Protected').

### Post Statuses
- 'Published' posts are viewable by everyone.

- 'Protected' posts require a specific password to view.

## Post Management
